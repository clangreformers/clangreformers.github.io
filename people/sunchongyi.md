Character Evaluation

Mr. Sun Chongyi is a knowledgeable and talented scholar who dedicated his life to two things: compiling dictionaries and educating students. Even after several decades, his former students from Beijing Normal University and the affiliated middle school still recall his brilliant lectures, and he held deep affection for his students. After receiving visits from over twenty classmates, he emotionally composed a poem that goes: "In October, the autumn scenery is beautiful, as numerous talents come to my home. Looking at each other, we recall the past, and our conversations are filled with memories of the present. Warm sentiments on paper, hidden blossoms in a pot. Emotions merge in the depths, while parting sentiments are sent with lingering twilight." His words reflect his deep love for his teaching career.

Since the time of the Republic of China, he participated in the compilation of more than ten dictionaries, which played a crucial role in establishing and disseminating standards for the Chinese language.
