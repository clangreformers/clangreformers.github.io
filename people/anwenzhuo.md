An Wenzhuo, born in 1907, is originally from Wuxi, Jiangsu, and lives in Kaifeng.

In August 1928, An Wenzhuo graduated from the Men's Attached School of Henan University and was admitted to the Department of Chinese Literature of Henan University.

In August 1930, An Wenzhuo transferred from Henan University to the third year of the Department of Chinese Literature at Tsinghua University, becoming a fourth-level student at Tsinghua.

In June 1932, An Wenzhuo graduated and was admitted to the Graduate School of Arts at Tsinghua University, but he did not enroll and was hired as a teaching assistant by Liu Wencian.

During his time at Tsinghua, An Wenzhuo served as a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Esperanto Association of Tsinghua University, but he did not publish any works. The first issue of "Summer Vacation Weekly" described him as "quick to argue, often sickly and prone to melancholy, and not robust," while contemporaries commented that he was "lacking in scholarly cultivation."

In July 1935, An Wenzhuo was dismissed by Jiang Tingfu and Zhu Ziqing, after which he entered the Editorial Office of the Great Dictionary of China and participated in the compilation of the "Mandarin Dictionary."
