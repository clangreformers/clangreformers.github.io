Fu Yan's University Graduation Photo

In 1928, graduated from the Department of Chinese Language at Beijing Normal University.

From 1930 to 1937, taught at the Tianjin Municipal Normal School (now "Tianjin Normal University Higher Vocational School"), which was suspended due to the Anti-Japanese War.

Previously worked at the Zhonghua Book Company, participating in the compilation of the "Cihai" (Dictionary of Terms).

Served at the Chinese Dictionary Compilation Office, contributing to several dictionaries.

In 1949, he gave a talk on the "Latinized New Writing Scheme" at the "New Script Learning Society" established by the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University.

In 1956, the Chinese Dictionary Compilation Office merged into the Language Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and he retired due to illness in 1955 (another account states that due to the Hu Feng incident, he was reassigned to work in the library of a high school in Shanghai's Pudong (Lingqiao Middle School)).
