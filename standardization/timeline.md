At the end of nineteenth century, people involved in the Reform Movement thought China's weakness derived from “Lack of enlightenment” of the people.  “Lack of enlightenment” of the people came from the trouble and difficulty in learning Chinese. Starting from general education, there is the need to reform Chinese. As a result, some people proposed alphabetical systems.
