Ninety Years of Reflection

In the ordinary city of Yan, a man named Mu Li,

Holds a pure heart, cherishing truth, defining his identity.


Guided by two mentors, seeking strict teachings,

Half a lifetime devoted to nurturing the young, diligent in his dealings.


The rise and fall of China weighs heavily on his mind,

Exploring language and literature, he strives for purity refined.


At the age of ninety, he understands the essence of life,

Hoping to preserve his virtuous heart as evening arrives.

Solitary Goose's Lament

In memory of my late wife, Wang Ronghua, Two Quatrains

(1)

For over fifty years, we shared love and devotion,

Supporting each other with unwavering loyalty in every emotion.

But in the face of illness, no medicine could revive,

I shed tears of grief for the loved one no longer alive.

(2)

Helpless, the strings of the Yaoqin have come undone,

Sorrow and anguish fill my heart, making it overrun.

With deep longing, I recall your graceful and charming ways,

Nurturing our children with your wise words, a legacy that stays.
