The Compilation Office of the Great Chinese Dictionary was the first specialized dictionary institution in modern China. Comprising the country's first group of linguists, this institution undertook extensive work under extremely challenging conditions. They compiled selections from 440 books and newspapers, created 2.5 million index cards, employed statistical methods for word selection, and compiled various dictionaries such as 'Commonly Used Characters in National Pronunciation' (1932), 'New Radical Index National Pronunciation Dictionary' (1949), 'Additional and Annotated Commonly Used Characters in National Pronunciation' (1949), 'National Language Dictionary' (Eight-volume edition, 1945), 'National Language Dictionary' (Four-volume edition, 1947), 'Dictionary of Learning Culture' (1952), 'Homophones Dictionary' (1956), etc. They played a critical role in standardizing modern Chinese language and promoting vernacular Chinese.

So, which linguists were part of this institution, and what were their positions and fates?

The three former directors of the Compilation Office, Li Jinxian, Qian Xuantong, and Wang Yi, were advocates and promoters of the national language movement. They were highly knowledgeable, innovative, and socially responsible. However, their academic achievements came to an abrupt halt for various reasons, which is regrettable.

Mr. Li Jinxian (Shaoxi) achieved the status of a scholar at the age of 15. He was one of the earliest advocates for replacing classical Chinese with vernacular Chinese, promoting the change from "Guowen" (National Text) to "Guoyu" (National Language) in education. He played a significant role in this transformation, advocating for the use of vernacular Chinese in place of classical Chinese, and even proposing the removal of "reading classics" from primary education. He was one of the founders of the "National Language Research Association" and a standing committee member of the "National Language Preparatory Committee."

Mr. Li completed "A New Grammar of National Language," which provided the framework for the grammar of the national language. He published "A Synopsis of the History of the National Language Movement," an important document in the national language movement. He served as the chief editor of "A National Language Dictionary" and other significant works that helped standardize phonetics and semantics.

He established national language learning centers to promote the use of the national language among the general public. He also founded a specialized program for the national language to train national language instructors in Taiwan after the recovery, allowing the national language to be used in Taiwan.

The proposals he and Qian Xuantong and others put forward, such as "reducing the strokes of Chinese characters" and "Romanization of Chinese characters," served as prototypes for the current use of Chinese characters and Hanyu Pinyin on the mainland. However, after 1949, his academic achievements were limited. Perhaps it was his adherence to the principle of "a gentleman does not favor any particular party" that made it difficult for him to flourish under the new regime. He continued to serve in various roles, including as a member of the Committee for Text Reform, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), until his passing in 1978. Nevertheless, as a pioneer of the national language movement, his irreplaceable contribution to modern Chinese language, writing, and education is undeniable.


Mr. Qian Xuantong was an absolute radical in the national language movement. He was among the first to publish articles in vernacular Chinese in "New Youth" and initiated or co-initiated multiple proposals with the Ministry of Education, advocating for the simplification of Chinese characters and the romanization of the Chinese language. Mr. Qian served as the chief editor of the "Commonly Used Characters in National Pronunciation," officially establishing the Beijing dialect as the national pronunciation standard. It was designated by the Ministry of Education as the dictionary for promoting uniform pronunciation of Chinese characters. He also edited the first edition of the "National Language Dictionary." Unfortunately, Mr. Qian passed away in 1939 in Japanese-occupied Beijing due to illness at the young age of 52. This was undoubtedly a significant loss for the national language movement.

Wang Yi (Yiguang) was a key figure in the Compilation Office. He was older and had a wealth of experience in education and publishing before his involvement in the national language movement. He held various positions, including high school teacher, supervisor of Yingkou Commercial School, editor-in-chief and manager of "The New China Daily," and lecturer at the Ministry of Education, Beijing Normal University, and Beijing Normal School. In 1913, during the Unified Pronunciation Conference organized by the Ministry of Education, Mr. Wang was a member and participated in the standardization of the national pronunciation of over 6,500 Chinese characters and the formulation of a set of phonetic symbols. In 1925, as a member of the "Committee for the Augmentation and Revision of National Pronunciation Dictionary," he decided that the phonetic symbols should conform to the Beijing pronunciation. As a member of the "National Language Preparatory Committee," he played an active role in promoting the national language. Alongside Mr. Li Jinxian, he traveled throughout the country to promote the national language. He also established national language learning centers and personally taught national pronunciation. His compiled teaching materials became the basis for the later publication of "A New Course in National Pronunciation" (1924), which became the first practical national pronunciation textbook in the national language movement.

Mr. Wang was also a member of the "Group of Several Individuals" initiated by Liu Fu and participated in the formulation of the Romanization of Chinese characters. He compiled a promotion manual for phonetic symbols, which was later printed as a book and used as teaching material in various learning centers for years. During the War of Resistance against Japan, as one of those who remained in Beijing, Mr. Wang maintained and led the work of the Compilation Office. He self-funded and published the eight-volume edition of the "National Language Dictionary." This edition included content related to Japanese, bearing the mark of Japanese influence. After the war, he gradually withdrew from the national language and education circles and moved to Taiwan to live with his eldest son, disappearing from the public eye. He passed away in 1960. Mr. Wang also had a deep interest in shorthand and developed his own system. He once operated the "National Language Shorthand Learning Center" and authored works such as "Modern Chinese Shorthand" (1919) and "The Study of Wang Yi's National Language Shorthand" (1931).

Compared to Mr. Qian Xuantong, Liu Fu, Bai Dizhou, and Ma Lian's early deaths were truly regrettable.

Liu Fu (Ban Nong), who had worked at the Zhonghua Bookstore in Shanghai, actively introduced Western literature by authors like Hans Christian Andersen, Alexandre Dumas, and Leo Tolstoy to China. Later, he published a series of articles in "New Youth" and was exceptionally appointed as a professor of Chinese language at Peking University's preparatory department by Cai Yuanpei. Subsequently, he traveled to the University of London and the Sorbonne in France to study phonetics. He authored works such as "Experiments on the Four Tones" and "A Phonetic Symbol Table for Investigating Chinese Regional Pronunciations," specializing in phonetics. He advocated for language reform and initiated the "Group of Several Individuals." After 22 discussions, they drafted the "Romanization of Chinese Characters in the Phonetic Style," laying the foundation for Chinese Pinyin. In 1934, while working on the compilation of "A New Score for the Four Tones," "A Regional Pronunciation Dictionary," and "A Language Map of China," Liu Fu conducted extensive dialect and phonetic research in areas like Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia along the Ping-Sui Railway, despite the scorching heat. Tragically, he contracted relapsing fever and passed away in Beiping (now Beijing) at the age of 44.

Bai Dizhou (Huo Zhou) was known as a practical figure in the national language movement. Despite challenging financial circumstances, he supported his family while pursuing his education and only graduated from Peking University's Department of Chinese Language at the age of 30. Afterward, he worked as the director of academic affairs at Beijing Normal School and later joined Peking University as a faculty member. At the young age of 19, Bai Dizhou became a member of the National Language Preparatory Committee and devoted himself to the study of phonology and dialects. He served as the head of the Compilation Office's Collation Department and the editor-in-chief of "National Language Weekly." Some of his notable works include "Report on the Investigation of the Guanzhong Dialect," "Table of Contemporary Pronunciations for the Entering Tone in the Guangyun Rhyme Dictionary," "Examination of Rhyme Categories in the Jiyun Rhyme Dictionary," and "Study of the Evolution of Entering Tone in the Northern Pronunciation." In 1934, despite the passing of five close relatives, he continued to work diligently. He accompanied Mr. Liu Fu on a dialect survey in the northwest and, unfortunately, also contracted relapsing fever. He passed away in the same year as Mr. Liu, at the young age of 34. His death deeply saddened his close friend Lao She, who wrote several pieces in his memory, including "Remembering Dizhou" and "Mourning Bai Dizhou."

Ma Lian (Yuqing) was one of the famous "Five Mas" from Ningbo, Zhejiang. The "Five Mas" consisted of five brothers: Ma Yuzao (Professor of Chinese Language at Peking University), Ma Heng (Professor of History at Peking University), Ma Jian (Professor of Chinese Language at Yanjing University), Ma Jun (Professor at Peking University), and Ma Lian (Professor). Ma Lian, during his youth, enjoyed reading works from the late Ming dynasty. Later, influenced by scholars like Wang Guowei and Lu Xun, he tirelessly collected, organized, and studied classical novels, operas, storytelling, drum songs, treasure volumes, and folk songs. He became a renowned scholar in the field of novel and opera studies. His manuscripts, such as "Yuqing's Miscellaneous Notes" and "Catalog of Undignified Library Books," are preserved in Peking University Library. He was also a collector of ancient novels and operas. During his lifetime, he often accompanied scholars like Qian Xuantong, Liu Banong, and Zheng Zhenduo to visit and purchase books in Liuli Chang, a famous book market. In 1935, at the age of 42, Ma Lian passed away suddenly due to a cerebral hemorrhage while at the lectern in Peking University. His collection of 5,286 books was organized by experts like Wei Jiangong and Zhao Wanli and purchased by Peking University Library in 1937.

When it comes to achieving great success and recognition, two distinguished individuals stand out at the Compilation Bureau: Mr. Zhao Yuanren and Mr. Wei Jiangong.

Mr. Zhao Yuanren was arguably the most renowned and versatile figure at the Compilation Bureau. He had a broad and deep knowledge base, having earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Cornell University and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard University while also studying music. He taught at Cornell University in the physics department and later at Tsinghua University in the physics, mathematics, and psychology departments. He was part of a group of scholars at Tsinghua University, along with Liang Qichao, Wang Guowei, and Chen Yinque, who were collectively known as the "Four Great Mentors of Tsinghua." Zhao was an expert in phonetics and, as a research fellow at the Institute of Linguistics, conducted extensive fieldwork on languages and folk music. He composed famous songs, served as the president of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA), was elected as the first Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and became a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS). Even after retiring from the University of California, Berkeley in 1962, he continued as a professor emeritus and passed away in 1982 in the United States. In the year before his death, he was received by Chinese leaders, granted the honorary title of professor by Peking University, and can be considered a true winner in life.

In contrast to Mr. Li Jinxi, Mr. Wei Jiangong's (Tianxing) later years were even more remarkable. A graduate of Peking University who remained at the university as a faculty member, he served as a standing committee member of the Committee for the Unification of National Language and later as the director of the National Language Promotion Committee in Taiwan. His early life laid the foundation for the promotion of the national language in Taiwan, making him a pioneer in Taiwanese national language education. After 1949, he became the president of the Xin Hua Dictionary Publishing House, overseeing the compilation of the first edition of the "Xin Hua Dictionary." He also participated in the revision and editing of works such as the "Dictionary of Chinese Idioms" and "Ci Yuan." Wei authored specialized books like "Studies on Ancient Chinese Phonology" (1935), which were used as textbooks in universities. He established the Classical Chinese Literature program at Peking University. Mr. Wei was not only a member of the 93 Society, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, but also a member of the Beijing Municipal Political Consultative Conference and a representative of the National People's Congress. After his passing in 1980, a bronze statue was erected in his honor at the School of Arts and Humanities at Peking University, securing his lasting legacy.

The Compilation Bureau saw the graduation of four classmates from the Beijing Normal University Department of Chinese, who would later become pillars of the bureau. They were all students of their predecessors like Li Jinxi and Qian Xuantong.

Sun Kaidi and Wang Chongmin were each accomplished in their respective fields but had tragic endings.

Sun Kaidi (Zishu) was born into an intellectual family in Cangzhou, Hebei. After graduating from college, he taught at Beijing Normal University, Peking University, and Yanjing University in the Department of Chinese. Simultaneously, he worked as an editor at the Beiping Library. Proficient in various fields, he was a Dunhuang scholar, classical literature expert, and theater theorist. While working on dictionary projects, he decided to establish a new field of research, novel bibliography. He extensively explored libraries, schools, and private collections, resulting in works like "Bibliography of Chinese Popular Novels" in ten volumes, "Bibliography of Novels Seen in Tokyo, Japan" in six volumes, and "Bibliography of Novels Seen in Dalian Library" in one volume. He also published works like "Corroborating Evidence for Novels" and "Cangzhou Collection." After 1949, he worked at Peking University's Institute of Literature until his passing in 1986. Except for the period of the Cultural Revolution, he never ceased his research. During that tumultuous time, his book collection was confiscated, leading to a period of mental instability. Losing his books was a lifelong regret. In the summer of 1986, leaders from Peking University's Institute of Literature visited the seriously ill Sun Kaidi. When asked if he had any unfinished business, he wrote the character "书" (book) on his palm. Until his death, many of his works remained unorganized and unpublished. For a straightforward intellectual whose life could be summarized with the words "reading" and "writing," what greater regret could there be?

Wang Chongmin (Yousan) was a bibliographer, Dunhuang scholar, and sinologist. He served as the first director of the National Library of China. He began his career as a lecturer in the Chinese Department at Hebei University in Baoding and later at Beijing Furen University. He then worked at the Beiping Library, where he was sent abroad to major libraries in France, the UK, Germany, Italy, the United States, and other countries to search for precious Chinese documents that had been scattered overseas. In 1939, he was employed by the Library of Congress in the United States to catalog Chinese rare books in their collection. He returned to China in 1947 and continued working at libraries while also serving as a professor in the Chinese Department at Peking University. He managed the department's library and later founded the Library Science program at Peking University.

In June 1974, Jiang Qing excitedly announced the "discovery" of a book by Li Zhuowu titled "A Synopsis of History" during a "struggle session" in Tianjin. They were preparing to publish it. However, after expert assessments, the book was declared a forgery, disappointing those who had hoped for a political breakthrough. They then turned to Wang Chongmin, an authority on bibliographies and a Peking University professor. Wang Chongmin's evaluation also concluded that the book was a forgery, which further disappointed them. They pressured him to continue "research" on the matter at the library, essentially expecting him to arrive at a conclusion that aligned with political interests. When they didn't get the results they wanted, they started criticizing Wang. Unexpectedly, Wang Chongmin followed in the footsteps of Wang Guowei and ended his life in Kunming Lake at the Summer Palace. He couldn't bear any compromise of knowledge and scholarship by political powers.

Wang Shuda and Fu Yan, though not well-known, were not ordinary individuals. They were the right-hand men of Mr. Li Jinxi.

Wang Shuda (Shankai) started his career as a teacher at the Affiliated High School of Beijing Normal University after graduating. He played a key role in supervising the compilation of the 12-volume "General Index of Group Elegant Literature and Dialects" at the Compilation Office and participated in the compilation of almost all the dictionaries published by the Compilation Office, including the "Chinese Language Dictionary." Mr. Wang also served as a lecturer in the Chinese Language Specialization Program at Beijing Normal University, where he trained a group of Chinese language teachers for Taiwan, contributing to the popularization of Mandarin in Taiwan. After 1949, he joined the Institute of Linguistics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and became one of the principal compilers of the "Modern Chinese Dictionary." Later, he moved to Beijing Normal College in Hebei (now Hebei Normal University), where he helped establish the Chinese Department and became an associate professor until his retirement. He never left the field of Chinese language education.

Fu Yan (Jieshi) taught at the Tianjin Municipal Normal School after graduation. He published books like "Outline of Chinese Philology" (1933) and was an editor for the "Cihai, First Edition" published by the Zhonghua Book Company in 1940. Similar to Mr. Wang Shuda, he was involved in the compilation of nearly every dictionary published by the Compilation Office. After 1949, he, along with Wang Shuda and others, participated in the compilation of the first edition of the "Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme (Draft)." However, there is little information available about his whereabouts later. Some recall that he was influenced by the Hu Feng case and was later sent to work in a high school library in Pudong, Shanghai.

Xiao Jialin and Kong Fanjun, both from the Compilation Office, were a rare couple dedicated to the early promotion of the Chinese language movement and devoted their lives to this cause.

Mr. Xiao Jialin (Dichen) made significant contributions to the early promotion of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet (pinyin). In 1929, he became the editor-in-chief of the "Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Weekly" and published the book "Introduction to the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet." He also chaired the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Promotion Association, which was founded in July 1930 with only a dozen members at the time. As the Deputy Chairman of the Committee for the Promotion of Mandarin, he was involved in the compilation of the "Chinese Language Dictionary." Simultaneously, he served as the editor-in-chief of the "People's Dictionary" (1932), which collected commonly used words for everyday applications based on the Beijing dialect as a standard, aimed at educating the general population.

Mr. Xiao authored several professional articles such as "A Study of Retroflex Consonants" and "How to Pronounce and Repeat Compound Words." To promote Mandarin, he took on the role of editor-in-chief for the "Mandarin Daily." His wife, Mrs. Kong Fanjun, also contributed to the early promotion of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet and published related articles. She served as the primary lecturer for the fourth session of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Promotion Association's classes.

After 1949, the couple continued to work together and became the principal compilers of the first editions of the "Modern Chinese Dictionary" and the "Xinhua Dictionary." Mr. Xiao Jialin later served as an Associate Researcher at the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences until his passing in 1968.

The most important work produced by the Compilation Department was the "Chinese Language Dictionary." The compilation of this dictionary endured the turmoil of war and took over a decade to complete. Mr. Xu Yishi, who steadfastly worked on its compilation from start to finish, was a legendary figure.

Xu Yishi, originally named Xu Renyu, was a former Qing Dynasty scholar who held the position of a minor official at the seventh rank in the Ministry of Justice. After the Xinhai Revolution, he worked as a special correspondent for the "Minquan Daily" and "Zhonghua Minbao" in Jinan, and then served as a correspondent and editor for the "New China Daily" in Beijing, as well as the "Jingjin Times" and "Jingbao." He contributed as a special writer to publications like the "Morning News" and "National News Weekly," consistently engaging in historical research and verification of facts. He was a prominent figure in the study of historical anecdotes in modern times and authored numerous short essays on historical anecdotes, preserving a wealth of valuable historical materials. He was hailed as a "giant in the field of modern historical anecdote materials."

Mr. Xu Yishi joined the Compilation Department in 1928 and remained a compiler for the "Chinese Language Dictionary" from start to finish. Concurrently, he also taught at the People's University Department of Journalism, the Salt Administration Specialized School, Beijing National Studies Supplementary Society, and the Beijing National Studies Academy. In 1958, through the introduction of Mei Lanfang, he became a librarian at the Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Culture and History, where he worked until his passing in 1971. His brother, Xu Lingxiao, was also a renowned journalist and expert in historical anecdotes. They jointly published the "Lingxiao and Yishi Essays" in the "National News Weekly" for five years, although this work was never compiled into a book. However, Xu Yishi left behind collections of his work, including "Yishi's Miscellaneous Essays," "Yishi's Conversations," and "Discussion and Evaluation." In May 1983, the Beijing Bibliographic Literature Publishing House compiled and republished "Yishi's Miscellaneous Essays" and "Yishi's Conversations" as a combined work.

Another legendary figure at the Compilation Office was Mr. Wang Shoukang (茀青). He played a pivotal role in promoting the national language movement across the Taiwan Strait and made the greatest contribution to the promotion of the national language in Taiwan. Mr. Wang was also a student of Li Jinxi at Beijing Normal University. His legend lies in the fact that he twice laid down his pen to take up arms during the Northern Expedition and the Anti-Japanese War, showing a strong sense of social responsibility.

He had taught at Beijing Women's Normal University and Beijing Law and Commerce College. He also held positions such as the head of the Engineering Bureau in Beijing and the director of the People's Education Hall's cinema in Jinan, Shandong. During his tenure as an associate professor of the National Language Specialized Program at Beijing Normal University, he was ordered to go to Taiwan and brought with him the "National Language Gazette," of which he was the deputy editor-in-chief. Later, he became the head of the National Language Specialized Program at Taiwan Provincial Normal College. In 1956, he co-founded the National Language Teaching Center at National Taiwan Normal University with Liang Shi'ao and served as its director, teaching foreign students to learn Chinese and gaining worldwide fame. In January 1959, during a speech on language education counseling work across Taiwan, he suffered a stroke, resulting in the loss of his language function. He passed away on April 12, 1975.

Mr. Wang Shoukang's life was marked by his dedication to the national language movement and education. He overcame numerous challenges and obstacles to make an indelible mark on the national language movement and the field of Chinese language education in Taiwan.

At the inception of the Compilation Office, the Republic of China government was grappling with a severe famine. Salaries were delayed, not just in academic institutions like this one, but even in universities and government agencies, and teacher strikes were commonplace. As a result, the finances of the Compilation Office were consistently challenging, and often they had to rely on advanced royalties to sustain their work. Due to these difficulties, some positions could only be obtained through recommendations. For instance, several of Li Jinxi's students were recommended and nurtured by him, including Zhang Weiyu. Others like Xiao Jialin and Zhang Xunru were recommended by Wei Jiangong.

Zhang Weiyu, also known as Yusheng, graduated from Changsha Normal College and was a classmate of Li Jinxi and Li Jinhui. He was once employed as a private tutor in the Li family. After being hired by the Great Dictionary Compilation Office in 1919, he collaborated with Li Jinxi on works like "Phonetic Differentiation of National Pronunciation," "<Shuowen> and <Guangyun> Annotation Phonetic Index," and "Changes in Trends of National Language over Four Thousand Years." He also drafted the "Supplementary National Pronunciation Dictionary," edited and distributed the monthly "Text Alliance," and advocated for mass education and enlightenment. He was concurrently appointed as the head of the Second Mongolian Nursery in Beijing. He excelled in playing folk music and was appointed by Cai Yuanpei as the instructor for Peking University's Music Research Association and its affiliated Music Teaching Institute, where he contributed numerous compositions to publications like "Music Magazine" and "Jinde Quarterly." He passed away in 1972, and his son became a renowned cello educator.

Zhang Xunru, originally named Dezé, initially entered the Second Civilian Night School Teacher Training Class sponsored by Peking University. Later, while attending high school at Dongcheng Middle School, he switched to studying English. After an introduction by Wei Jiangong, he worked at the Qing Imperial Household Committee as a secretary. Starting in 1927, he worked at the Palace Museum Library. In 1929, he became a secretary, commissioned compiler, and special compiler at the Chinese Great Dictionary Compilation Office. In 1947, he served as a national language instructor at Peking University's Preliminary Class. In 1959, he worked in the Archives Studies Department of Renmin University of China, then was transferred to the Central Archives until his retirement in 1971. Interestingly, Zhang Xunru was a historian and archival scientist by profession, and his amateur interest was researching language issues.

Sun Chongyi graduated from Beijing Normal University and later joined the Great Dictionary Compilation Office. He followed Wang Shude into Beijing Normal University Affiliated High School and taught there alongside Wang Shude. They both went on to teach at the National Language Specialized Program at Beijing Normal University, where Sun Chongyi became one of the principal compilers of the "Modern Chinese Dictionary." He later moved to Hebei Beijing Normal College, where he dedicated his life to the field of Chinese language research and education until his retirement.

Mr. Xu Shirong was a junior figure at the Compilation Office. Mr. Wang Shude was his teacher at Beijing Normal University Affiliated High School. He joined the Compilation Office and taught at the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University, where he focused on language teaching and research. He made significant contributions to the promotion of Standard Chinese (Mandarin) and its teaching. His works primarily centered on phonetics and were easy to understand, straightforward, practical, and suitable for educational purposes. He combined phonetics with education and literature, creating various radio teaching materials for the promotion of Standard Chinese and the Chinese phonetic alphabet system (Pinyin). He personally delivered these broadcasts, which had a considerable impact nationwide. Additionally, he developed a teaching theory for reading instruction, which was beneficial for elementary and middle school Chinese language teaching. He also worked as a phonetics teacher at Renmin University of China, Beijing Film Academy, and Beijing Broadcasting Institute. He participated in the Standard Chinese Pronunciation Committee's work and later served as an associate researcher at the Chinese Character Reform Committee.

Xiao Jiewu, hailing from humble beginnings, dedicated himself to the revolution in his early years and worked his way through school in France. He graduated from the Sino-French University in Beijing in 1924. He engaged in revolutionary work under the leadership of the Communist Party and contributed to the promotion and teaching of Marxist economics at institutions such as the Sino-French University in Lyon, Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow, Peking University, Beijing Normal University, Hunan University, and Wuhan University. He held various positions, including Secretary of the Franco-Chinese Workers' Joint Committee at the Sino-French University in Lyon, translator at the Sixth Congress of the Communist International, professor at the Economics Department of Hunan University, and later, Dean of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. After the departmental reorganization in 1953, he served as a professor at the Economics Department of Wuhan University. He is believed to have worked alongside Liu Yi (Songming) on the "Chinese-French Dictionary." Liu Yi was the chief editor, and the dictionary was completed in 1933. It primarily used Chinese with French translations and annotations, serving as a reference for those translating from Chinese to French.

There are a few more individuals about whom we know very little. Cui Ji (Shaoxi), who served as the chief editor of "Dialect Examination" in five volumes, did he later go to England for further studies? Wang Zongjian (Jingting), a native of Beiping (now Beijing), who once proofread specialized legal materials like "Criminal Procedure Practice," "General Principles of Civil Law," and "Criminal Procedure Practice." Was he a legal professional? Could his work be related to the promotion of standard national language and phonetic symbols for court case filings at the time? Luo Linzhang (Jifei), who in July 1930 served as the main lecturer for the fourth session of the National Language Shorthand Training Institute, but there is no further information available about him. Peng Wangqun (Xinru), along with Mr. Xu Shirong, was involved in the entire compilation process of the "National Language Dictionary," but there isn't much more information about them. Could Sun Ruidi (Shuyan) be a relative of Sun Kaidi? Then there are those who have completely disappeared into the annals of history, including Xiao Kun (Benheng), Li Shouming (Youqin), Weng Bingyi (Dehui), Shang Jiabin (Kuoquan), Zhao Yuzhen (Shanzhai), Qiu Xueming (Yueqiu), Suo Enkun (Yutang), Yuan Zhesheng, Chen Wenguang, An Wenzhuo, Sun Peiliang, Lu Xiuru, and others.

The Compilation Office, from its formal establishment in 1928 until it merged with the Institute of Linguistics in 1956, went through 28 years of tumultuous times, including wars and changes in government. This group of linguists tirelessly persevered throughout, all for one goal: to harmonize and enrich the Chinese language. Compiling dictionaries and reference books was a selfless act, without fame or profit. However, when we are fluent in using Chinese today, how many of us truly understand that there was once such a group of people who devoted their entire lives to shaping the standards of our national language? They should not be forgotten.
