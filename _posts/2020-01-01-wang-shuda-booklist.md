During the earlier part of the 20th century, Grandpa was a long-time teacher of Chinese in the Boy's High School Affiliate to Beijing Normal University as well as Beijing Normal University. He was also a part-time teacher at the Girls High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University, the top girls high school in Beijing and other accredited institutions. He taught Chinese, Chinese Phonetics, Chinese Phonology, and more. Grandpa was an extraordinary teacher. His students include Jingcheng Gao, Fuzeng Gao, Shuqing Shi, Cengzhong Xuu, Fushi Wang, Ruiling Deng, Niantai Sun, Nianzeng Sun, Yunzhong Lu, and Xiyan Li etc. They all later made outstanding achievements in the fields of Chinese Study, Literature, and History.

The scholars of this period had a habit of collecting books. Their book collections were not just for the sake of collection, but more for reading and research. Grandpa had a special room in the house dedicated to be his study. It occupied the best location of the family compound. He not only studied there, but often slept there, as if he was totally immersed in books. Grandpa was a not only a teacher, but he also needed to take care of his parents, raise his six children, and help out his younger siblings who were still students. No matter how difficult life was, he would allocate a quarter of his salary to buy books. In his book, Random Essays, the famous actor from Beijing People's Art Theater, Shizhi Yuu recalls: "In middle school, I dreamed of becoming a scholar, and would focus my study on Chinese Phonology. Chinese Phonology is so deep and profound, how can children understand it? But teachers knew how to make it not only understandable, but interesting. This intrigued me. I would admire the teacher's knowledge and everything about them. I still see in my head the study of my middle school teacher Wang Shankai. Books were stacked up on all four sides, in the same glass bookshelves. The shelves were very tall, starting from the floor, reaching the ceiling. Professor Wang taught me, "Prelude to the meaning of words" ( 说文解字序) in this study – ''古者, 庖牺氏之王天下也', '王', a verb here, pronounced with the fourth tone (`). In this manner, he broke down the difficult sentences into components and talked about the origin of Chinese characters. He told me it was not very believable that CangJie single handedly invented words: How can one person create all of the words? Why couldn't other people have created some too? 

Teacher Wang's study didn't seem to be very brightly lit, but I still remember the arrangements well- even the posture and positions of the two of us sitting there while he was teaching. How fascinating: the study and the knowledgeable owner of the study!

Grandpa's nephew Jingchun remembers: "Uncle loved the books as if they were his life. He asked Aunt to buy lots of dark blue hand-woven clothes. He would make book covers by himself. Then he carefully put those ancient books inside. Children were not allowed to touch them."

The following are part of grandpa's book collections. They would make any credible library envyious Hopefully they give a glimpse of grandpa's academic pursuit.
