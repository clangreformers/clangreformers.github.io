The National Language Movement was advanced by a very special group of people, most of whom were engaged in research or education related to the national language and shared common ideals and sentiments. Many of them were colleagues, classmates, or friends, and there were also intricate familial ties among them, which is a fascinating phenomenon.

## Brotherly Love in Battle — Li Jinxī (Shaoxi), Li Jinhui (Junquan), Li Jinxu (Jichun)

Li Jinxī is the eldest of the "Eight Talents of the Li Family" and a well-known core figure in the National Language Movement.

Li Jinhui is the second oldest. He worked at the Zhonghua Book Company and was among the first members of the Preparatory Committee for the Unification of the National Language. In the early stages of the National Language Movement, Li Jinhui was quite active and initiated proposals at the National Language Association in his personal capacity multiple times. He participated in the editing of the "National Phonetic Dictionary," served as a member of the committee for the revised "National Phonetic Dictionary," and was a member of the National Language Romanization Phonetic Research Committee. He also served as the principal of the Shanghai National Language Specialized School established by the Zhonghua Book Company. He was concerned with children's literature and initiated the founding of the magazine "Little Friends." Because he had a passion for music from a young age, he turned to the Chinese pop music industry, composing popular songs such as "Mao Mao Yu," and led his "Chinese Song and Dance Troupe" on tours, which was controversial at the time and derided by some as frivolous. Later, he did not return to the National Language cause but became a pioneer in modern Chinese musical theater and pop music.

Li Jinxu is the fourth eldest and studied in Germany; he later dedicated himself to popular education in China. While serving as the head of the Department of School Education at the Chinese Popular Education Promotion Association, he was commissioned by Mr. Yan Yangchu, the Secretary-General of the Popular Education Association, to specifically promote teaching research and experimental work on phonetic symbols in Ding County, Hebei. Through this experiment, Ding County achieved outstanding results in using phonetic symbols to facilitate education and eliminate illiteracy.

## Celebrities Who Bring Their Own Attention — Zhou Shuren (Lu Xun), Zhou Zuoren (Qiming), Zhou Jianren

In China, this refers to the names of the pelicans. The three Zhou brothers are...
The individuals actively participated in the Mandarin language movement, and their influence played a significant role in awakening the public.

Zhou Shuren became an advocate for the Mandarin language movement during his time at the Ministry of Education. He participated in the first phonetic unification conference and successfully introduced the phonetic symbols invented by Zhang Taiyan in collaboration with members from Zhejiang. Moreover, his most significant achievement was promoting the vernacular movement through his writing, which inspired a generation of youth to engage in a revolutionary wave of thought.

As a professor in the Chinese department at Peking University, Zhou Zuoren was appointed by the university to serve as a member of the Mandarin unification preparatory committee and the committee for organizing the provincial characters. He frequently initiated proposals, actively advocated for children's literature, and gave specialized speeches on the subject. He was a principal contributor to the "Mandarin Weekly" and published articles such as "Mandarin Romanization" in "Language Threads," playing a supportive role in the Mandarin movement.

## A Son Inherits His Father's Profession — Cai Xiyong (Yijing), Cai Qi, Cai Zhang (Ziying), and Cai Wei

Cai Xiyong graduated from the Tongwen Institute in Guangzhou. He once served as a translator at the Qing government's embassy in the United States and later held positions as Director-General of the Guangdong Bureau of Foreign Affairs and the Hubei Railway Administration. Using the shorthand system of the American Lindsley, he developed a phonetic script for Chinese and authored the book Fast Characters for Transmitting Sound, which was published in 1896. His shorthand system featured 16 initials and 26 finals, with each initial and final forming a character. His three sons carried on his legacy.

In 1905, Cai Qi and Cai Zhang revised Fast Characters for Transmitting Sound, and the updated version was reprinted that year by the Hubei Official Publishing Bureau.

Cai Zhang, the sixth son of Cai Xiyong, went to Japan in 1903 to study shorthand systems in Japan and the United States. He later published the book Chinese Shorthand Studies, which inherited and developed his father's system. He served as the First-Class Secretary and Head of the Shorthand Division of the Qing government's Advisory Council, and as the chief instructor of the Capital Shorthand School. Over more than ten years, he taught more than 2,000 students. The shorthand work of early Republican-era parliaments was all handled by his students. Cai Zhang was also a member of the Pronunciation Standardization Association and authored Phonetic Simplified Characters. In 1922, he was awarded the Second Class Chiaho Decoration by the Nationalist Government. It can be said that Cai Zhang far surpassed his father in the field of simplified and shorthand writing.

Cai Wei, the younger brother of Cai Zhang, also inherited the family craft. He was a shorthand expert and worked as a stenographer in institutions such as the Institute of Translation Studies.

## The Father's Right-Hand Men — Wang Yi (Yi'an), Wang Gongxia, and Wang Gongli

Wang Yi was a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Unification of the National Language and a core figure in the editorial office of the Comprehensive Chinese Dictionary, alongside Qian Xuantong and Li Jinxi. During the Japanese occupation, he was entrusted with overseeing the editorial work and, despite having no stable funding, successfully led the publication of the eight-volume edition of the Mandarin Dictionary. The shorthand method he invented was widely used at the time. His two sons—one in Taiwan, the other on the mainland—each inherited his mission and became, in every sense, Wang Yi's right-hand men.

Wang Gongxia, Wang Yi's eldest son, was a lead instructor at the Mandarin Shorthand Training Institute and a member of the Commission for the Promotion of Zhuyin Fuhao (phonetic symbols). He later settled in Taiwan with his father.

Wang Gongli, Wang Yi's second son, also served as a lead instructor at the Mandarin Shorthand Training Institute. He inherited his father's dictionary-editing work and remained on the mainland, continuing to promote his father's shorthand system. He once gave a presentation on Wang Yi's life at the "Symposium Commemorating the 63rd Anniversary of Wang Yi's Shorthand System."

## Father and son on the battlefield — Lu Ji (Yu'an) and Lu Yiyan

Lu Ji (Yuan'an) was one of the earliest individuals in the Ministry of Education to promote the Mandarin movement through publications. He was later appointed as a committee member of the Mandarin unification preparatory committee by the Ministry of Education and served on the committee for the "Revised Dictionary of Mandarin Phonetics." He published a phonetic teaching book in Suzhou. Although elderly and in poor health, he consistently participated in the meetings of the Mandarin association and diligently fulfilled his responsibilities as a committee member.

Lu Yiyan, the second son of Lu Ji, specialized in phonetics and was particularly devoted to the study and promotion of the standard Mandarin pronunciation. He served as an editor in the Mandarin Literature Department of the Shanghai Zhonghua Bookstore and as an instructor at the Mandarin-specialized school established by the bookstore. He was then appointed as a member of the Ministry of Education's phonetic symbols implementation committee and as a tutor in the phonetic symbols training group. During the "Peking vs. Mandarin" debate, he represented the anti-Peking pronunciation faction. He authored works such as "New Mandarin Textbook" and "Usage of Mandarin Phonetic Symbols," and co-founded the "Children" Weekly with Li Jinhui, focusing on children's literature creation.


## Business partners in harmony—Xiao Jialin (Dichen) and Kong Fanjun (Fanjun)

Defining Xiao Jialin and Kong Fanjun's roles in the Mandarin movement with the phrase "husband sings and wife follows" could not be more appropriate, and their steadfast commitment to this endeavor has been unwavering.

Both Xiao Jialin and Kong Fanjun graduated from Beijing Normal University. Xiao Jialin began his career in the Ministry of Education, while Kong Fanjun started as a teacher at Nankai Middle School. In 1928, they both worked at the People's Dictionary Division of the Chinese Great Dictionary Editing Office, with Xiao Jialin serving as the director and Kong Fanjun as an editor. To promote phonetic symbols and Mandarin romanization, they both took positions at the Shandong People's Education Institute, where they conducted training and authored textbooks, using phonetic symbols as a tool for eradicating illiteracy, achieving remarkable results. In 1950, they were invited to join the Xinhua Dictionary Publishing House and became the main editors of the "Xinhua Dictionary," and later transitioned together to the Dictionary Editing Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, becoming the principal writers for the "Modern Chinese Dictionary."

The synchronicity of Xiao Jialin and Kong Fanjun as a couple was so perfect that their names frequently appeared together in publications. In 1933, in the report of the "Second Annual Meeting of the China Society of Education," the names "Xiao Dichen" and "Kong Fanjun" were side by side; in 1934, at the "First National Congress of the Mandarin Romanization Promotion Association" held in Jinan, their names appeared consecutively in the "Jinan Representatives" section; at the end of 1934, following the death of Bai Dazhou, their names appeared shoulder to shoulder in the joint "Eulogy for Bai Dazhou," mourning their colleague; they both became members of the Jiu San Society on March 9, 1951, and even in the personnel statistics of the Jiu San Society, their names were closely adjacent.

Eulogy for Bai Dizhōu

## Uncle and Nephew Educators — Qian Xuantong (Yigu) and Qian Daosun

Qian Xuantong is already well-known to many; his brother was the famous diplomat Qian Xun from the late Qing dynasty, while Qian Daosun is Qian Xun's eldest son and Qian Xuantong's nephew. Qian Daosun was also a prominent scholar, having studied in Japan and Europe, fluent in multiple languages, and he was the first person to translate Dante's "Divine Comedy" into Chinese. At the first phonetic unification conference, Qian Daosun represented Zhejiang and became one of the supporters of Zhang Taiyan's phonetic alphabet, subsequently serving as a member of the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee.

## Working Together for Education — Xiao Jialin (Dichen) and Dong Weichuan

Xiao Jialin and Dong Weichuan both graduated from the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University. During their university years, they participated in the National Language Movement and served together as main contributors to the "National Language Weekly." After graduation, Dong Weichuan began his teaching career, and his wife, Kong Wenzhen, is the elder sister of Kong Fanjun, also dedicated to teaching. After taking the position of director of the Shandong Provincial People's Education Institute, Dong devoted himself to public education. While in Shandong, he actively promoted phonetic symbols alongside Xiao Jialin and others, using them as a tool to eradicate illiteracy and promote education, achieving remarkable success. They were also advocates and promoters of the national phonetic Romanization.

## In-Laws from Afar, Same Sound Across the Straits — Bai Dizhōu (Zhenying) and Qi Tihen (Shaoh)

Bai Dizhōu and Qi Tihen were both from "Old Beijing," but they were of Mongolian ethnicity. Bai Dizhōu's original surname was Bai Jite, while Qi Tihen's original surname was Qilute; both later adopted Han surnames. Both were friends of Lao She; the three of them once traveled together in Nanjing, though there is little documented about their familial ties.

On October 12, 1934, Bai Dizhōu passed away due to illness. In his diary on October 19, Qian Xuantong wrote: "Upon reaching a certain sea, I met Shao and also met Qi Shao (Tihen) (whose original surname is Qilute, and also a Mongol, he is the brother-in-law of Dizhōu, coming to pay his respects due to Dizhōu's death)." Qi Tihen traveled from the south to mourn Bai Dizhōu. Based on their origins and relationships, it can be inferred that Qi Tihen was the elder brother of Bai Dizhōu's wife.

Interestingly, Bai Dizhōu and Qi Tihen had little interaction during the process of the National Language Movement, yet they…
The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have become the standard pronunciation for promoting Mandarin. In August 1933, Bai Dazhou produced the "Standard Mandarin Phonograph Records" at the China Publishing House, which became the standard pronunciation for Mandarin teaching.

Qi Tiehen served as an editor and translator at the Commercial Press, participated in the editing work of the "Etymological Dictionary," and was the head of the Mandarin department at the Correspondence School of the Commercial Press. The books he compiled, "Elementary Mandarin Conversation" and "Advanced Mandarin Course," were adopted as textbooks by many elementary schools. In July 1946, he was hired by the Ministry of Education's Mandarin Promotion Committee and moved to Taiwan, working at the "Taiwan Provincial Mandarin Promotion Committee," where he began a 31-year long effort in promoting Mandarin. In Taiwan, every morning at 7 a.m., Mr. Qi Tiehen served as the "Mandarin pronunciation demonstrator" on the radio, reading from popular Mandarin textbooks, Mandarin conversation, and various subjects such as Mandarin, general knowledge, and history from national schools, providing listening material for those learning Mandarin and correcting pronunciation. He became a well-known master, and even now, older Taiwanese people can recall Mr. Qi's charming "Beijing accent." Qi Tiehen became the standard pronunciation for Mandarin in Taiwan and naturally became the pioneer of Mandarin in Taiwan.

## Classmates and Brothers – Fu Yan (Jieshi) and Wang Shuda (Shankai)

Fu Yan and Wang Shuda were both graduates of the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University in 1928. Fu Yan's mother was Wang Shuda's paternal cousin, making them distant relatives. Although they were only far relatives, the two brothers shared common interests and hobbies. After graduation, they worked together at the Chinese Dictionary Compilation Office for many years, co-editing dictionaries such as "Enhanced Chinese New Rhyme," "Revised and Annotated Common Words in Mandarin," "Cultural Dictionary," and "Homophones Dictionary." In 1956, they also entered the Dictionary Editorial Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences together. Fu Yan's main accomplishments were in dictionary compilation; he was also one of the editors of "Cihai," published by the China Publishing House in March 1947. Wang Shuda concentrated his energy on teaching, serving for many years as a Chinese language teacher at Beijing Normal University, the affiliated high school of the Normal University, and Hebei Normal University.

## Teacher-Student Relationship – The Teacher and Student Connecting Past and Future – Wang Zhao and Wang Pu

Wang Zhao can be regarded as a pioneer of the Mandarin movement. Because he was wanted by the government multiple times, he mostly lived in seclusion. Wang Pu was his student. In 1902, he submitted a petition to the Minister of Education Zhang Baixi to approve the implementation of Wang Zhao's Mandarin phonetic alphabet, stating that this was a convenient method that allows everyone to read books, everyone to read newspapers, and everyone to read the edicts and announcements. In 1903, without official approval, Wang Zhao established the Mandarin Phonetic School in a rented house in Dongcheng's Biao Pei Hutong in Beijing, using woodblock printing. Wang Pu taught the Mandarin phonetic symbols, while Wang Zhao listened from outside the classroom. When the first meeting for unifying pronunciation was held, both teacher and student attended as representatives of Zhili Province. Due to conflicts over pronunciation during this meeting, both the chairman Wu Jingheng and Wang Zhao resigned in succession, and Wang Pu took over as chairperson, deciding to pass the "National Pronunciation Promotion Plan" and others. After the conclusion of the pronunciation unification meeting, Wang Pu continued to promote the implementation of the meeting's outcomes, and took the initiative to establish a phonetic symbol training institute in Jingzhao. When the National Language Unification Preparation Committee was established, Wang Pu served as a member. He published the book "Compilation of National Pronunciation Draft" and participated in the publication and validation of the initial edition of the "National Pronunciation Dictionary" in 1919. Wang Pu inherited and promoted the Mandarin phonetic symbols invented by Wang Zhao, becoming a pivotal figure in the national language movement.

## Deep Feelings and Sincere Intentions—Qian Xuantong and Wei Jianggong

Qian Xuantong was Wei Jianggong's teacher, and they became core figures in the national language movement together. Their collaboration was highly tacit; they supported each other not only academically and professionally but also shared a genuine friendship in life. Once, Qian Xuantong discovered errors in Wei Jianggong's article "Similarities of Wu Songs," and he immediately pointed them out and wrote a letter to Wei Jianggong to correct them. When Qian Xuantong wanted to publish the "National Language Weekly" under his own name, he first thought of asking Wei Jianggong for assistance, to which Wei readily agreed. They often engaged in perfect collaborations: for example, on Hu Shi's fortieth birthday, the congratulatory text sent in the name of the National Language Society was written by Wei Jianggong and inscribed by Qian Xuantong. Wei Jianggong wrote the epitaph for Liu Banong, and Qian Xuantong requested Zhang Taiyan to inscribe the title for the tombstone, which brought comfort to the early-departed friend and their family. When Qian Xuantong, as the head of the Chinese Department at Beishi University, struggled to recruit professors amid the uprising of students, Wei Jianggong went to help. Likewise, when Wei Jianggong's Dawn Middle School opened, Qian Xuantong would also go to show support.

Exchanging and gifting books between Qian Xuantong and Wei Jianggong was a common occurrence, with Qian Xuantong particularly fond of tagging along with Wei Jianggong for meals, whether at restaurants or at Wei's place.

At home, regardless of the time, especially when feeling down, Qian Xuantong said that seeing Wei Jianggong could "relieve boredom and dispel sleep." Even if there were guests at the Wei residence, with "three beds and seven people in one room," Qian Xuantong could still "sit and chat." Initially, when Wei Jianggong and Wang Bishu had their informal wedding ceremony, Qian Xuantong would still participate. In 1933, when the situation in Beiping became tense due to war, Qian Xuantong's wife and children moved south, and Wei Jianggong specifically went to see them off. The Qian family hosted fewer guests and lacked tables and chairs, so Mrs. Qian would borrow from the Wei family. When Wang Bishu, Mrs. Qian, lost her father, Qian Xuantong wrote an inscription for him. The most touching moment between them occurred in 1937 when Wei Jianggong headed south, and Qian Xuantong wrote a postscript to a handroll of Mr. Wei Weinong's "Instructions for Grandson." When Wei Jianggong bid farewell, he gifted Qian Xuantong an L-shaped seal he had carved. Little did they know, this would be their final farewell.

After Qian Xuantong's death, Wei Jianggong became the leading figure in promoting the national language movement at Peking University.

## Devotion to the National Language Movement—Liu Banong and Bai Dizhou

Liu Banong was Bai Dazhou's teacher. After obtaining his Ph.D. in phonetics in Paris in 1925, he returned to teach at Peking University and established his own phonetics laboratory. Bai Dazhou, who enrolled in Peking University after starting work, had to study while supporting his family, which was a heavy burden.

Later, he became a teaching assistant in Liu Banong's phonetics laboratory. Bai Dizhou can be said to have closely followed in his teacher's footsteps. They jointly researched phonetics and also participated in the compilation of the Chinese Dictionary, advocating for Chinese character reform, promoting phonetic symbols, and the Romanization of Mandarin. They studied dialects together and conducted in-depth surveys in remote areas. Regrettably, they both contracted a tropical fever while investigating in the northwest, passing away just two months apart in the same year. Liu Banong and Bai Dazhou were the most capable figures in the national language movement, and their untimely deaths not only saddened many but also cast a shadow over the challenging path of the national language movement.

## Supporting the National Language Movement—Qian Xuantong, Li Jinxi, and Their Students

At the Chinese Dictionary compilation office, there was a group of active young people, all students of Qian Xuantong and Li Jinxi at Beijing Normal University. After graduation, they engaged in teaching or publishing, tirelessly promoting phonetic symbols in their respective positions.


The Mandarin language movement saw important editorial work being done by individuals who were also engaged in the editorial office, including: Hsiao Chia-lin, Sun Kai-ti (Zi Shu), Wang Shu-da, Wang Shou-kang (Fa Qing), Fu Yan, Sun Chong-yi (Wei Yi), Niu Ji-chang, Xu Shi-rong, and others. Among them, some had always followed Mr. Li Jinxi, such as Wang Shu-da, Fu Yan, Sun Chong-yi, and Niu Ji-chang; others later established their own paths. Sun Kai-ti specialized in the study of classical novels and opera, working at schools like Fu Jen Catholic University and Peking University; Hsiao Chia-lin dedicated himself to the cause of popular education and later worked with Wei Jian-gong on compiling the "Xinhua Dictionary"; Wang Shou-kang was dispatched by the Ministry of Education to Taiwan to promote Mandarin, becoming one of the main founders of Mandarin education in Taiwan. Regardless of where they were, they remained committed to the beliefs and principles about Mandarin that were imparted to them by their two teachers. In the spring of 1964, old friends from the editorial office of the large dictionary gathered in Zhongshan Park, where Li Jinxi, He Danjiang and their spouses, Hsiao Chia-lin, Kong Fan-jun and their spouses, as well as Wang Shu-da, Sun Chong-yi, Xu Shi-rong, and others, took the rare opportunity to walk and chat together, their teacher-student bond and camaraderie evident.

Many participants in the Mandarin movement had numerous connections. Figures like Li Jinxi had a background in the Ministry of Education and was a prominent teacher at Beijing Normal University, making him a powerful figure. However, leveraging their connections to discover and utilize talent was a means to achieve success, which can be seen as a positive relationship. It was this very relationship that allowed the Mandarin movement to start from a blank slate and form an organic whole, progressing through difficulties.
