		##Our Mission:
“Case Studies of Chinese Language Reformers” is a U.S. and California-registered non-profit (Tax ID: 83-2358327) dedicated to collecting, studying, and documenting the people and events that shaped the standardization and modernization of the Chinese language, preserving this key chapter of history to deepen understanding of modern Chinese culture, education, and its pioneers. Once, China’s many dialects and inconsistent written meanings hindered communication, but thanks to reformers like Master Li Jinxi and his students, the ideal of “words with universal meaning and language with universal pronunciation” is now a reality—students across mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong can learn Standard Mandarin through Pinyin or Zhuyin and communicate seamlessly across regions.
