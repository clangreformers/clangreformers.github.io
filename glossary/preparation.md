The National Language Unification Preparatory Committee was established on April 21, 1919, as an administrative body under the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China, tasked with promoting the unification of the National Language. This organization played a crucial role in advancing the standardization of the National Language with government authority. Its main members came from the previously established National Language Research Society. The president was Zhang Yilin, and the vice presidents were Yuan Xitao and Wu Jingheng. Members included those appointed by the Ministry: Li Jinxian, Chen Maozhi, Shen Yi, Li Buqing, Lu Ji, Zhu Wenxiong, Qian Daosun, and 41 others; those elected by directly administered schools: Qian Xuantong, Hu Shi, Liu Fu, Zhou Zuoren, Ma Yuzao, and 35 others; and those recruited by the committee over time: Zhao Yuanren, Wang Yi, Cai Yuanpei, Bai Zhenying, Xiao Jialin, Zeng Yijin, Sun Shiqing, Fang Yi, Shen Jianshi, Li Jinhui, Xu Dishan, Lin Yutang, Wang Pu, and 38 others.

The committee's major achievements included:

The promulgation of Zhuyin (Bopomofo) symbols (completed during the preparatory period), their phonetic classifications, and subsequent revisions.
The publication of the "National Pronunciation Dictionary" and "Revised National Pronunciation Dictionary" to establish standardized pronunciation norms.
Issuing various directives, including changing school language departments from Chinese to National Language departments, promoting vernacular writing and Zhuyin symbols, establishing inspection and guidance systems with rewards and penalties, and setting up training institutes.
In 1928, the Ministry of Education reorganized the committee into the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee, appointing Wu Jingheng as the chairman and Qian Xuantong, Li Jinxian, Chen Maozhi, Wang Yi, Shen Yi, Bai Zhenying, Wei Jiankong, Zhao Yuanren, and Xiao Jialin as standing committee members. The committee was composed of a total of 31 members, including Cai Yuanpei (Jiemin), Zhang Yilin (Zhongren), Wu Jingheng (Zhihui), Li Yuying (Shiceng), Li Shuhua (Runzhang), Qian Xuantong (Yigu), Li Jinxian (Shaoxi), Chen Maozhi (Songping), Wang Yi (Yian), Hu Shi (Shizhi), Liu Fu (Banong), Zhou Zuoren (Qiming), Li Buqing (Lianfang), Shen Yi (Duoshan), Lu Ji (Yu'an), Zhu Wenxiong (Zaowu), Wei Jiankong, Zeng Yijin (Shudu), Sun Shiqing (Huiqing), Fang Yi (Shuyuan), Shen Jianshi, Li Jinhui, Zhao Yuanren, Xu Dishan, Bai Zhenying (Dizhou), Lin Yutang, Ren Hongjun (Shuyong), Ma Tican (Ziliang), Qian Daosun, Ma Yuzao (Youyu), and Xiao Jialin (Dichen).

In subsequent work, the committee continued to organize the promotion of Zhuyin symbols (originally Zhuyin letters); formulated and advocated for the National Government to publish the "National Language Romanization Method"; established the Compilation Office of the Great Chinese Dictionary, publishing the "National Pronunciation Commonly Used Word Collection," which became the first dictionary to standardize National Pronunciation; and subsequently published other important dictionaries such as the "National Language Dictionary." They also published magazines like "National Language Monthly" for the promotion and research of the National Language; promoted the use of National Pronunciation in telegraphs, station signs with Romanized phonetics, and Zhuyin symbols; advanced the use of National Pronunciation in radio and sound films; proposed promoting National Language education, including the teaching of Zhuyin symbols in primary schools; compiled Zhuyin reading materials and newspapers, designed and cast Zhuyin Chinese character molds, and promoted the use of Zhuyin symbols in the printing industry; and established the "National Language Literature Museum" to investigate, collect, organize, display, and catalog National Language historical materials.

In May 1935, the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee was dissolved due to funding issues, and its functions were replaced by the National Language Promotion Committee.
