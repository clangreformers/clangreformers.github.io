In May 1935, due to funding issues, the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee was dissolved. With efforts from Wu Jingheng and others, the Ministry of Education established the National Language Promotion Committee to continue some of the functions of the former committee. On July 28, 1935, the National Language Promotion Committee held its founding meeting in the Party Department of Beiping (now Beijing), with Wu Jingheng as the chairman and Wang Yi, Qian Xuantong, Li Jinxian, Chen Maozhi, and Wei Jiankong as standing committee members. The committee ceased operations in 1937 due to the war but reconvened in Chongqing in 1940 for its second plenary meeting, expanding the organization to resume its work.

In 1945, the Legislative Yuan of the Republic of China passed the "Regulations on the Organization of the National Language Promotion Committee," which provided legal basis for the committee's establishment. The regulations stipulated that the National Language Promotion Committee should consist of 19 to 27 members appointed by the Minister of Education; a chairman and 1 to 3 standing committee members designated by the Minister from among the members. The committee was required to hold a full committee meeting once a year, with the option to convene special meetings as necessary, and standing committee meetings once a month, all convened and chaired by the chairman. The committee could organize itself into working groups, each headed by a director appointed by the Minister of Education; it could also employ 1 or 2 clerks and 1 to 3 assistants, and hire 1 or 2 employees if needed. The committee could invite external experts for discussions on specialized topics. Except for full-time members, committee members did not receive salaries but could be reimbursed for travel expenses for attending meetings.

In 1946, the Ministry of Education established the National Language Promotion Committee at the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, with Wei Jiankong as the chairman; He Rong as the vice chairman; and Fang Shiduo, Li Jiannan, Qi Tiehen, Sun Peiliang, Wang Yuchuan as standing committee members. Other members included Ma Xueliang, Li Jinxian, Lin Shaoxian, Gong Shuchi, Xiao Jialin, Xu Xuxian, Zhou Bianming, Zhang Tongguang, Zhu Zhaoxiang, Shen Zhongzhang, Zeng Depei, Ye Tong, Yan Xueyi, Wu Shouli, and Wang Ju. In October, the committee published the "National Language Daily" in Taiwan.

In 1949, as the government of the Republic of China retreated to Taiwan, the Ministry of Education did not restore the National Language Promotion Committee. At that time, only the Taiwan Provincial National Language Promotion Committee continued to operate. Subsequently, local National Language Promotion Committees were established in various counties and cities, such as the Taipei City National Language Promotion Committee established by the Taipei City Government on November 8, 1969.

On July 1, 1959, the Taiwan Provincial National Language Promotion Committee was merged into the Department of Education, renamed as the "Taiwan Provincial Government Department of Education National Language Promotion Committee," continuing to oversee the promotion of the National Language in Taiwan. In 1981, to strengthen National Language education, the "Ministry of Education National Language Promotion Committee" was reestablished according to the "Regulations on the Organization of the Ministry of Education National Language Promotion Committee." On January 1, 2013, with the reorganization of the Executive Yuan's functions and structure, the National Language Promotion Committee's organization and functions were incorporated into the Fourth Section of the Department of Lifelong Education under the Ministry of Education, becoming part of the Reading and Language Education Division.
