The Pronunciation Standardization Association was an important institution within the Mandarin Language Movement.

In December 1912, the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China, based on Article 8, Section 7, of the "Official Regulations of the Ministry of Education," formulated the constitution of the Pronunciation Standardization Association with eight articles, establishing a preparatory office within the ministry and appointing Wu Jingheng as its director. At that time, there were 80 members, and the association held its first formal meeting on February 25, 1913. During the meeting, with 44 members present, Wu Jingheng was elected as the chairman, and Wang Zhao as the vice-chairman. The outcomes of the meeting were as follows:

Approval of the national pronunciation: Over a period of more than a month, national pronunciation for over 6,500 characters was approved through a voting process, laying the foundation for the "National Pronunciation Dictionary."

Confirmation of phonemes and adoption of letters: Various proposals for letters were put forward at the time, including radical-based, symbol-based, and Roman alphabet-based approaches. However, a consensus was not reached, so a temporary "phonetic alphabet" was adopted. This alphabet, created by Zhang Binglin, consisted of 36 initials and 22 finals, and it later evolved into the "Phonetic Symbols."

Adoption of the "Methods for Promoting National Pronunciation," consisting of seven articles. On May 22, 1913, the Pronunciation Standardization Association formally concluded its session.
