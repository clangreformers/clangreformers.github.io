## Background

The name "Chinese Dictionary Compilation Office" (中国大辞典编纂处) began in 1928, but its origins can be traced back to the Reform Movement a century earlier. Reformers believed that China's weakness lay in the lack of enlightenment among the people, which in turn was caused by the difficulty of Chinese characters and the vast number of illiterates. Starting from the goal of popularizing education, they proposed ideas and plans for script reform. In 1913, the first Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation of the Republic of China was convened, voting to approve the pronunciation of 6,500 characters, which boosted the demand for a standard National Language and a Dictionary of National Pronunciation. Due to political turmoil, the first edition of the "Dictionary of National Pronunciation" and the "Revised Dictionary of National Pronunciation" were not published until 1919 and 1921, respectively. In 1920, the "Committee on the National Language Dictionary" was established to engage in the standardization of "words". In 1923, the fifth annual meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Unification of the National Language (hereinafter referred to as the "National Language Committee") under the Ministry of Education decided to organize a "Committee for the Revision of the Dictionary of National Pronunciation" and authorized the "Committee on the National Language Dictionary" to raise funds independently to establish a "National Language Dictionary Compilation Office" to carry out the work.

## Establishment

In 1928, the National Language Committee renamed the National Language Dictionary Compilation Office to the "Chinese Dictionary Compilation Office" (hereinafter referred to as the "Compilation Office"), and it took over the revision work of the original "Dictionary of National Pronunciation". The Republican government simultaneously allocated the "West Four Courtyards" of the former Presidential Palace in Zhongnhai (i.e., Jurentang) as the office space for the Compilation Office (Telephone: West Bureau 2506), and the work of the Compilation Office officially began.

## Organization

The Compilation Office aimed to "settle the accounts of four thousand years" and, following the principle of "working according to historical rules", organized a massive system: it established five departments for Collection, Investigation, Arrangement, Compilation, and Statistics, with divisions under the departments, totaling 15 divisions. Although the structure was large, due to limited funding, there were not many personnel.

The initial board members of the Compilation Office included: Ma Lian (Library of the Sino-French University Comte School), Li Jinxi (Beijing Normal University), Liu Fu (Peking University Music Laboratory), Xiao Yu (Sino-French Education Foundation), Y.R. Chao (China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture), Wang Yi (National Language Committee), and Yuan Tongli (National Peiping Library). Key staff members included: Li Jinxi (General Director), Qian Xuantong (Director of the National Pronunciation Dictionary Division, Compilation Dept.), Liu Fu (Director of the University Dictionary Division, Compilation Dept.), Wang Yi (Director of the National Pronunciation General Dictionary Division, Compilation Dept.), Xiao Jialin (Director of the Popular Dictionary Division, Compilation Dept.), Liu Yi (Director of the Chinese-French Dictionary Division, Compilation Dept.), Bai Dizhou (Director of the Arrangement Dept.), Sun Kaidi (Director of the Books and Newspapers Division, Collection Dept.), and Wei Jiangong (Full-time Compiler). Special Compilers included Wang Chongmin and Ma Lian. Other compilers included: Zhang Weiyu, Wang Shuda, Cui Ji, Wang Zongjian, Xu Yishi, Yuan Shaohua, Peng Wangqun, Luo Linzhang, Kong Fanjun, Wang Shoukang, Xiao Jiewu, and Xiao Kun. Secretaries included: Li Shoupeng, Sun Ruidi, Weng Bingyi, Shang Jiabin, Zhao Yuzhen, Qiu Xueming, Zhang Xunru, and Suo Enkun.

## Achievements

By August 1933, after 5 years, the Compilation Office had clipped and recorded 440 types of books and newspapers, accumulating nearly 2.5 million cards. The first step in compiling a dictionary is to collect such a quantity of materials; at that time, only the "Oxford English Dictionary" in the UK could compare. During this process, the work of the Compilation Office produced many "by-products". Although they could not all be printed due to limited funds, many were published in periodicals of other academic institutions or published by various bookstores through copyright leasing. They generally fall into five categories:

The Compilation Office had an unnoticed Statistics Department. Its task was to collect a certain annual quantity of books and newspapers and calculate the frequency of occurrence of each character and word to distinguish between common, occasional, and rare usage, for the purpose of determining whether to include them when writing dictionary entries. This foundational work of character and word statistics was a pioneering initiative in the history of lexicography in our country.

It should be said that the most important achievement of the Compilation Office was the completion of the "Dictionary of National Language" (Guoyu Cidian). It became the standard for the National Language at home and abroad and has been used in Taiwan to this day. The "Modern Chinese Dictionary" (Xiandai Hanyu Cidian) published later in the mainland was also compiled based on the personnel and materials of the Compilation Office. It can be said that the work of the Compilation Office laid the foundation for the establishment of the National Language standard.

## Evolution

After the fall of Peiping in 1937, Li Jinxi planned to move the Compilation Office to Changsha, Hunan. He led Xiao Jialin and others to Changsha and established a temporary workplace at the Hunan Provincial Nanyue Library. Wang Yi and some remaining personnel raised funds on their own in Peiping and completed the compilation of the eight-volume edition of the "Dictionary of National Language" in 1944. Since Peiping was under the rule of the puppet government at the time, this edition was published using the name "Chinese Dictionary Compilation Office" and included a large number of Japanese loanwords. Other personnel of the Compilation Office had to find other livelihoods due to lack of funds and transportation problems amidst the war. After the victory of the War of Resistance in 1945, Li Jinxi returned to Beijing Normal University. The Compilation Office was approved to be affiliated with the Normal University, and a four-volume edition of the "Dictionary of National Language" was revised and published. After the establishment of the new government in 1949, publication work was managed by the General Administration of Press and Publication, and the Compilation Office only engaged in the compilation of a few small dictionaries. In 1956, the Chinese Academy of Sciences established the Institute of Linguistics and set up a Dictionary Editing Office. The Compilation Office, together with the Xinhua Dictionary Society of the original General Administration of Press and Publication, was merged into the Dictionary Office of the Institute of Linguistics, becoming the most capable professional dictionary compilation unit in our country.
