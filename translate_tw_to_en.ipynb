The ordinary ward housed sixteen patients, among whom was a patient suffering from liver disease. The painkillers were ineffective for him, and when the pain hit, he would scream at the top of his lungs. My mother repeatedly requested to change rooms, but the hospital responded that it was fully occupied and asked us to wait and see.\\n\\nThat morning, Gu Zhenggang and Zhang Baoshu came to visit my father. They frequently inquired about his well-being. After suffering a stroke, my father had difficulty speaking, yet he still wanted to speak up. He said:\\n\\n\"---I--- wow, wow, wow for three days, I can\\'t take it anymore---.\"\\n\\nThis meant that he had been in a coma from the stroke for three days and could no longer speak. The two officials advised him to take good care of himself and hurriedly left. Zhang Baoshu was a fellow townsman from Hebei and was then the Secretary-General of the Kuomintang; my father had previously worked with Gu Zhenggang at the Kuomintang headquarters in Beiping. My father had long since left the Kuomintang and had devoted himself to language education for decades. After Gu and Zhang\\'s visit, the hospital moved my father to a double room.\\n\\nThis was my father\\'s second severe stroke. A year ago, he had traveled around Taiwan with Professor Zhao Youpei, providing guidance on Mandarin education in various primary and secondary schools. His work was exceptionally busy with visiting lectures, reviewing students\\' essays, giving keynote speeches, and holding seminars, with tightly packed daily activities and the need to catch trains—the man hardly had a moment\\'s rest. On that particular day, he had given two speeches in a row, followed by a seminar, and teachers came to consult him in the evening, resulting in him staying up late and waking up unable to speak the next morning. The emergency physician hurriedly administered two injections before his speech abilities gradually returned.\\n\\nAfter returning to Taipei to rest for a while, my father\\'s language abilities returned to normal. Full of energy, he had no moments of idleness in his life and actively participated in Mandarin education work in northern Taiwan. One morning, he gave a lecture at Taipei Normal University, but when he returned home for lunch, he experienced swallowing difficulties and slurred speech. After taking a nap, there was no improvement. In the evening, he requested a home visit from the family doctor affiliated with the Mandarin Daily News.

When I woke up early in the morning, Dad was on the bed, gesturing wildly and shouting, with his left side clearly unable to exert any strength. \\n\\nAt that time, Taiwan did not have 119 ambulances, and it took a lot of effort to get him to the hospital urgently. He was hospitalized for three weeks, and after stabilizing, he returned home to recuperate. He needed to坚持 exercise every day; given time, he might be able to restore some level of health. Three months later, my father could manage most of his daily activities independently, but he was never able to speak and laugh as casually as before.\\n\\nMy mother often talked to me about my father\\'s past, lamenting: \"It\\'s all because of his speeches; your dad just loved to give lectures. The energy and excitement he felt on stage, along with the enthusiastic reactions from the audience, really made it hard for him to let go; he lost track of time and neglected his health—nothing could stop him.”\\n\\nAt that time, my father’s speeches truly had a significant reputation. When he delivered a formal speech, his voice was loud (it was an era without amplification), rhythmic and articulate, with a humorous and engaging style that included a wealth of references, making complex topics easy to understand. The audience listened attentively and sometimes found themselves laughing uncontrollably; when he spoke passionately, the applause resonated throughout the room. Many people were captivated by Professor Wang\\'s speeches. When he traveled south to assist in language education, Principal An of Kaohsiung Haiching High School would follow his schedule every day just to listen to Professor Wang\\'s lectures around Kaohsiung County and City.\\n\\nMy father\\'s old friend, Uncle Wang Yuchuan, once said, “If Mr. Wang Fa-qing is speaking about something, even if it is repeated ten times, people will never get tired of hearing it.”\\n\\nProfessor Liang Rongruo, my father’s classmate from Beishi University, later co-founded the Mandarin Daily with him in Taiwan. In one of his articles, Uncle Liang wrote:\\n\\n“Longevity, health, and a broad heart; he was honest and sincere, always willing to help young friends in difficulty. Many students have passed through his teachings, and he was accessible at any time—in the morning, at noon, late at night, or on Sundays, with small groups coming to consult him. Whether discussing academics, career, family life, or love issues, he listened attentively and responded seriously. ‘A good academic teacher is easy to find, but a true mentor is rare.’ He was a truly exceptional mentor.”\\n\\nMore than a dozen students from the Mandarin Studies program at Beijing Normal University came to Taiwan with Mr. Wang to promote Mandarin, and my father established a Mandarin Studies program at Taiwan Provincial Normal University.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1736638193, model='gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint='fp_72ed7ab54c', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=597, prompt_tokens=684, total_tokens=1281, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))\n",

He stood on the stage, not very tall, but very robust, with a broad face and a strong build. His hair was slightly thinning, though thick on the sides, and he wore a pair of round, old-fashioned glasses with red and black floral frames perched on his nose. Behind the lenses were powerful eyes, conveying a sense of kindness mixed with determination. One hand rested on his waist behind him, and the other gestured appropriately in front of him. His speech was powerful, his voice loud. In the large gathering of hundreds of people, listening to his lengthy speeches filled with profound insights and witty metaphors, laughter erupted frequently, and applause resonated. I can say that after listening to Mr. Wang\\'s speech, I have never heard a more outstanding speech from anyone else.\"\\n\\nMr. Zhong Lu-sheng, who graduated from the Mandarin Department of the Normal University, wrote an article titled \"Full of Energy: My Impression of Teacher Wang Fa-qing\":\\n\"Nine years ago, Teacher Wang Shou-kang gave us our first lesson, clearly stating the two main goals of the Mandarin movement: \\'Consistent Language and Unified Mandarin.\\' He recounted the successes and failures of the past Mandarin movement, sometimes jumping for joy, sometimes feeling dejected, at times gritting his teeth, and at other times in deep sorrow. His forehead sparkled with light, his trembling hands danced in the air, and his short, stout body swayed energetically as he spoke passionately. At that moment, a wave of warmth filled my heart. I clenched my fists and gritted my teeth, resonating with his emotions. I looked around at my classmates, all of whom were raptly listening, filled with enthusiasm. We deeply admired his passion for language education and his extraordinary talent for oratory!\"\\n\\nZhong Lu-sheng said: \"Whenever I felt disheartened, I would invite two or three classmates to seek encouragement from Teacher Wang. After a lecture from him, I would indeed feel invigorated, and all my frustrations would vanish!

Unexpectedly, the old scholar thought this student was a prodigy he had not encountered in many years—good memory and strong comprehension—and he should continue his studies.\\n\\nAfter two years of private school, a modern school was established in the county, and my father attended elementary school there. He recalled his childhood: primarily studying the Four Books, with some math classes. In the early years of the Republic, the language textbooks began to introduce Western content; for example, one lesson discussed President Washington chopping down a cherry tree. The teacher wanted the students to read the text aloud in unison, but nearby, a theater was loudly performing Hebei Bangzi opera, so everyone’s reading tone followed the opera style.

Later, his father, through hard work, gained admission to the affiliated high school of Beijing Normal University, which was the top high school in Beiping at that time.\\n\\nHowever, his father’s journey to university was not smooth; he took the entrance exam three times before finally being accepted into the Chinese literature department of Beijing Normal University. He told us it was all because of a single photograph. In the early years of the Republic, having a photo taken was a significant event; to apply to Beishida, he meticulously dressed in a long robe and coat, wearing a round Chinese hat, and was arranged to sit stiffly on a grand chair, with a backdrop featuring a tea table adorned with a vase of flowers, a water pipe, a covered bowl of tea, and so on. Back then, his father was dark-skinned and thin, and the person in the photo looked like a middle-aged man. Although his exam results were good, the examiners believed he looked too old and didn’t consider him for admission. A year later, he used the same photo for the exam again, and the result did not change. Not willing to give up, he took the exam once more and was finally accepted. His professor, Mr. Xia Yuzhong, later told his father the story behind it; Mr. Xia had stated in the examination committee:\\n\\n\"This student applied three times, and his scores were excellent each time. His unwavering spirit is quite commendable. Although he appears older, his perseverance is admirable, and his studies are solid. There shouldn’t be too strict an age limit for students at the normal university; being a bit older is also acceptable, as they will be teachers after graduation!\"\\n\\nIn early Republican Beiping, the academic atmosphere was particularly free and open, and earnest university students were able to learn the authentic teachings of various schools of thought. Some renowned teachers who taught his father included Li Jinxin, Qian Xuandong, and Huang Kan, all of whom were grandmasters of Chinese studies and prominent figures in their fields. After graduating from university, just as the National Revolutionary Army was launching the Northern Expedition, his father’s blood was boiling with passion; he abandoned academics for the military, heading south alone to join the Northern Expedition Army, where he was responsible for propaganda, soldier education, and other duties. After the Northern Expedition concluded, he returned to Beijing to help Mr. Li Jinxin compile the Mandarin Dictionary. Soon after, with the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan and the nation\\'s survival at stake, he took up the pen for the military once more, serving as a major instructor in the Southeast Third Theater of Operations, running a newspaper, broadcasting anti-Japanese messages, organizing literacy classes for soldiers, and leading a drama troupe to promote the resistance effort.

My father was invited by the Taiwan Provincial Department of Education to serve as a member of the National Language Promotion Committee, where he started the Guoyu Daily in Taiwan. In addition to publishing the newspaper, he frequently went on the radio to teach Mandarin, alongside Uncle Lin, who was originally from Fujian and provided translations in Taiwanese. The Taipei City Bureau of Education invited him to establish a Mandarin learning class for elementary school teachers, to correct actors’ stage pronunciations at Taiwan Film Studio, and he founded a specialized Mandarin program at the Provincial Normal University, later also establishing a Mandarin center to teach foreign students Chinese, keeping him extremely busy every day.\\n\\nUncle Zhao Youpei praised his old friend\\'s impressive speeches:\\n\\n\"When he stepped onto the podium, his presence was imposing and his delivery was vivid, so compelling that one could not help but be drawn in. Yet, he was also able to explain complex ideas in simple terms, with sparkling wit that delighted the audience, who laughed heartily and applauded enthusiastically.\"\\n\\nI didn’t listen to many of my father’s speeches on language education, but I remember one time he used \"The Flower-Tailed Dog\" as a topic: \"The flower-tailed dog is a dog, the flower dog tail is a part of a dog, and the dog tail flower is a flower.\" He constructed the following sentence: \"The flower-tailed dog chased its own flower dog tail and bit down on a dog tail flower.\"\\n\\nThere were many such examples that illustrated the wonder of the Chinese language.\\n\\nWhen he gave a speech in Taitung, someone gifted my father a black wood cane, which he cherished greatly and even hugged it to sleep that night. He happily said:\\n\\n\"In the future, I will use this cane to whack those confused individuals who are neither kind nor wise.\"\\n\\nUncle Zhao always praised my father as a steadfast and righteous man, open and straightforward, clear about public and private matters, tough despite being poor, increasingly tenacious in adversity, characterized by his masculine demeanor. When he was in high spirits, he would often swing his cane around or gesture emphatically.\\n\\nLanguage education was his strongest conviction. One of his students wanted to change careers, and my father told him:\\n\\n\"Why not go to the market and sell vegetables? Just sell whatever is in season!\"\\n\\nThat student remained devoted to his position in language education for his entire life.\\n\\nAnother student, who failed the national phonetics exam, passed on his second attempt and recalled:\\n\\n\"If Teacher Wang had given out easy grades back then, I wouldn’t be able to speak such beautiful Mandarin today.\"\\n\\nLi Zida (the famous director Li Xing) attended my father’s national phonetics class at Normal University and believed his Mandarin was already quite standard, thinking he didn\\'t need to attend class anymore.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1736638279, model='gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint='fp_72ed7ab54c', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=590, prompt_tokens=700, total_tokens=1290, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))\n",

I have only seen one true famous commentator in the world; my late father, known as Uncle Wang, is the one. The primary condition for being a famous commentator is to have a certain language spoken to a standard; no matter which language it is, if someone’s pronunciation is off and their tones are incorrect, the listener\\'s understanding immediately suffers, and their ability to express ideas lacks the most basic skills, let alone anything else. Only then can we talk about eloquence, humor, and wit; a wealth of knowledge is needed to draw on various references, grasp the balance of urgency and importance, maintain coherence and logic, and hit the nail on the head, leaving the listener enlightened.
